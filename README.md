# HOMEWORK: DOUBLY LINKED LISTS

Aru Poleo Vargas

## Dependencies

Gtest
CMake

## How to compile:

I provide a CMakeLists.txt file which will generate a make file for your
system when, from the build directory, the following is run:

	cmake ..

After, run make from the build directory and a testing binary should be generated
in build/bin

## Notes

Only a slight variation from the other linked list homework changing methods to
both change the state of the prev pointers of nodes and also to make use of them
for removing from the tail.
